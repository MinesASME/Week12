1. I copied my code from the week 10 homework
2. I used 'with' to open and automatically close the file the user wants to open.
Then I used a for-loop to parse through the file and store all the lines in a list.
3. I sectioned off pieces of the string, and concatenated them in the return statement.
4. I used a for-loop to increment a counter(int) the number of times the word came up in
the list.
5. I used a for-loop and an if-statement to loop through the names until found, and then output the name and the score. If it didn't find the name in the loop, it would print that
it couldn't find the player.
6. I concatenated the lists in the return statement.
7. I found what names were in both lists using a nested for-loop, and appended them to a 
list I returned.
8. I appended the strings in the first list if they weren't in the second list, then
returned it.
